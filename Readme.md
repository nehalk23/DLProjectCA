# Fake Emotion Detection Project

## Overview

The Fake Emotion Detection project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify emotions from grayscale facial images. The model is trained to recognize various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise with high accuracy. This project leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building, training, and evaluating the model.

## Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances training data with techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip.
- **Grayscale Image Processing**: Works with grayscale facial images to detect emotions.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN architecture for robust emotion detection.
- **Model Persistence**: Trained model is saved for future deployment in real-time applications.

## Installation
